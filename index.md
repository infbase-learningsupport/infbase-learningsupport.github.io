# What is InfBase?

InfBase is a drop-in helpdesk for first and second year students to get lab support and additional support for their courses.

Each session is supported by Informatics students in higher years, who can give 1-on-1 support and advice to help you work through problems with lab exercises that you are encountering on your core pre-honours Informatics courses.

In addition to supporting drop-in assistance, InfBase can be used as a place to work together with other students, with support from an InfBase demonstrator. Sessions will run in Appleton Tower 7.03 (7th floor).

<!-- If you have suggestions and feedback for InfBase, please [let us know how we are doing](feedback.html). -->
