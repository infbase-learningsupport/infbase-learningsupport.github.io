# What is InfBase?

InfBase is a drop-in helpdesk for first and second year students to get lab support and additional support for their courses. 

Each session is supported by Informatics students in higher years, who can give 1-on-1 support and advice to help you work through problems with lab exercises that you are encountering on your core pre-honours Informatics courses. 

In addition to supporting drop-in assistance, InfBase can be used as a place to work together with other students, with support from an InfBase demonstrator. Sessions will run in Appleton Tower 7.03 (7th floor).
